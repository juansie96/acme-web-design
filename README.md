# Acme Web Design - [WEBSITE LIVE](https://juansie96.github.io/acme-web-design/)

  This project consists on a website with 3 pages. It's main purpose is to deepen my knowledge of web design, focusing on pure CSS with responsive design.

  The website is finished. I practiced a lot of:
  
    1. Content positioning
    2. Dividing properly the CSS code on block areas.
    3. Correct and wide usage of semantic elements.
    4. Well defined id's and classes for styling manipulation
    5. Usage of media queries to make the website responsive.
    
  It was a really fun challenge and I'm looking forward to keep making more challenging websites and projects.
